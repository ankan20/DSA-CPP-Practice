# 📘 Daily DSA Practice in C++

This repository contains my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using **C++**.  
There's no fixed topic schedule — I practice and push whatever I learn or find interesting each day.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Stay consistent with daily practice
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered (So far)

I will update this list as I cover more:

- Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Selection Sort, Merge Sort)
- Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, etc.)
- STL (Standard Template Library)

> 📌 New topics are added as I learn — there's no fixed order.

## 📁 File Structure

There’s no strict folder structure. I name files descriptively based on the problem/topic, like:

selection_sort.cpp
binary_search.cpp
